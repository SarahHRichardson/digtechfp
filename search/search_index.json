I began this course knowing very little about creating websites - besides making some basic edits to a company website using HtML in an internship, I had almost no exposure to the field. Through this class, I was introduced to Google Sites, Mkdocs, Oxygen, and Github. This portfolio contains the three projects I completed in this course. Artifact 1 - Google Artifact 2 - Serpentina Artifact 3 - Backgammon The first project I completed in the course was a Google site where I talked about my previous experiences in digital literacy (currently serving as Artifact 1). Upon completing the Google site, I was introduced to the Serpentina Arts collaboration process. Halfway through the project, I created a static site, which is my Artifact 2. I edited the website to make it current before linking it to the porfolio, but left the original features of the site. After submitting the static site for the Serpentina Arts project, I began an information organization project, which took the form of a website that aimed to teach the reader how to play Backgammon. After completing the three projects, then revisiting my intitial digital literacy narrative and reflecting on my work this semester, I reallized how much I learned during this course. In the beginning of the course, the simplest aspects of writing with digital technologies felt foreign to me - it took me three class periods just to be able to make a functioning GitHub repository, and even when I was able to make one, elemets like formatting seemed beyond me. I learned strategies for working with digital technologies, and as of the end of the course, I am much more confident that I will be able to adapt to various digital technologies in the everyday world. While I did not develop a new set of tools for working with digital technologies, I did learn to tailor my google searches to user manuals for the technology and make sure to carefully look over the digital technologies and the options they offer before trying to use them. I made the mistake of not doing so in GitHub and Oxygen. I missed the place to format the Github website and where to put photos for my Oxygen webpage - both of which caused me unnecessary stress.After this course, I hope to recreate my TWC portfolio (currently a Google Site) in Github/Mkdocs. I also learned the feeling of total triumph when I was able to figure out something all by myself (like linking within a website or creting and using an image folder in visual studio code correctly)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-my-final-porfolio","text":"This website reflects my work throughout WRIT 4662W - Writing With Digital Technologies.

You can view a PDF version of the instructions here . DITA is an information classification and organization system, where information is broken up into its smallest units, called topics. Each topic is completed seperately, then combined to form a final product. The topics can be de-and-re-constructed at will to create whole sets of information. I enjoyed the DITA assignment because of the thought process behind DITA itself - creating many building blocks of information then stacking them into a higher purpose is a really interesting idea that could be incredibly useful when note-taking, or even beginning the writing process. Even though I faced some difficulties during the process that I needed to ask for help to solve, I believe that I have learned more about how to approach website creation software. Overall, I enjoyed using DITA/Oxygen, and I like the website I created.
