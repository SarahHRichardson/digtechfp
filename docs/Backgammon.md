DITA is an information classification and organization system, where information is broken up into its smallest units, called topics. Each topic is completed seperately, then combined to form a final product. The topics can be de-and-re-constructed at will to create whole sets of information. I enjoyed the DITA assignment because of the thought process behind DITA itself - creating many building blocks of information then stacking them into a higher purpose is a really interesting idea that could be incredibly useful when note-taking, or even beginning the writing process.

Even though I faced some difficulties during the process that I needed to ask for help to solve, I believe that I have learned more about how to approach website creation software. Overall, I enjoyed using DITA/Oxygen, and I like the website I created.
