# Artifact 2 - Serpentina Arts Project Website
### Using MkDocs and GitHub

For our semester long project in the class, we were tasked with working with an artist associated with Serpentina Arts, a Latin American artists' community based in the Twin Cities. I worked with a photographer and art educator, Juan Diego Perez la Cruz to create an artists' biography. 

Halfway through the project, I created a website using GitHub and Mkdocs to show the first draft of the biography and describe the process I used to get there. You can view the website [*here*](https://pages.github.umn.edu/rich1426/RichPort13/).

I have two final drafts - one is a half-page statement reminiscent of the one Juan Diego started with. The other is a page-long artists' biography. Both can be found on the website linked above.
